# The Problems with Earlier Paradigms

Before we dive deeper into microservices, it's important to understand the problems associated with earlier architectural paradigms - **Monolithic Architecture** and **SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)**.

During the time these paradigms were widely used, a number of issues surfaced. These problems spanned across multiple areas, including:

-   **Technology limitations**
-   **Deployment challenges**
-   **Operational costs**
-   **Scalability and flexibility**
-   **System maintenance and upgrades**

Some of these issues were so severe that they led to the **decline or disappearance of entire paradigms** - as was the case with SOA, which has effectively faded from use in its original form.

### Why This Matters for Microservices

Understanding the shortcomings of Monolith and SOA is critical when learning about **microservices**.

That's because microservices weren't just created to be a "new trend" - they were designed with **very specific goals** in mind. And those goals are **direct responses** to the pain points of their predecessors.

If we don't understand what went wrong with Monolith and SOA, we can't fully appreciate why microservices were introduced - or how to use them effectively.

### What's Next?

In this section, we'll review the key problems of both paradigms:

1.  We'll **start with Monolithic Architecture**, exploring its major drawbacks.
2.  Then, we'll move on to **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** and examine the issues that led to its decline.

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of **why the software development world needed a new architectural approach**, and why microservices emerged as the answer.

## A Single Technology Platform

In a monolith, **"single technology platform"** means **all components must be developed using the same development platform**. Since a monolith, by definition, runs as a **single process**, there's no way to implement its various components using different programming languages or technology stacks.

And that's not always ideal.

Sometimes, it's beneficial to use **multiple development platforms** within a single application - especially when different platforms have specific strengths that could enhance particular features. But with a monolith, that flexibility simply isn't possible.

You're tied to your **initial technology choice** for the entire lifecycle of the application.

#### Real-World Example

Let's say your application is built using **Node.js**, which is great for handling short web requests and I/O operations. But later, a new requirement comes in - your app now needs to handle **large document processing**, which isn't something Node.js excels at.

In a monolithic setup, you're forced to handle this new feature using Node.js, even though a platform like **.NET**, for example, would be much better suited for the task. This limitation can lead to inefficient or suboptimal implementations.

#### Technology Upgrades Become a Headache

Another issue with being locked into a single technology platform is **upgrading** that platform.

Let's say your app is built using **Java 8**, and you now want to upgrade to **Java 9**. In a monolith, you can't just upgrade one part of the application - you have to **upgrade the entire application at once**. This means you'll need to:

-   Test **all components**,
-   Ensure compatibility throughout the system,
-   Possibly refactor large portions of code,
-   And potentially delay the release due to extended testing cycles.

It turns what should be a small upgrade into a **major undertaking**.

#### Visualizing the Problem

Let's go back to our monolithic app example - the same one we used earlier to demonstrate monolith architecture.

Because of the **single technology platform limitation**, we must develop **all components** using a **single platform**. That means we can choose **.NET Core**, or **Node.js**, or any other platform we prefer - but we have to stick with it across the board.

If we wanted to use both - for example, .NET Core for some components and Node.js for others - that simply **isn't possible** in a monolithic architecture, due to the fact that everything must run inside a **single process**.

So that's the **fifth problem** with monolithic architecture:\
You're locked into one technology platform, which limits flexibility, performance optimization, and ease of upgrades.


### The Next Problem: Inflexible Deployment

Another major issue with monolithic architecture is its **inflexible deployment** process.

In a monolith, when you deploy the application, you must deploy the **entire application** - every time. There is **no way to deploy only a specific part** or a single component independently.

This means that **even a small update**, like a minor fix to one component, requires the **entire codebase to be redeployed**.

#### Why Is This a Problem?

Because deploying the whole application - even for a tiny change - forces teams to perform **rigorous testing** across the entire system. This leads to **long development and release cycles**, even for the simplest updates.

Let's look at an example:

Imagine you discover a small bug. Fixing it takes less than a minute and involves changing **just one line of code** - in an application with over **a million lines of code**.

Despite the simplicity of the fix, the entire application now needs to undergo:

-   Full **unit testing**
-   Complete **regression testing**
-   And finally, **full deployment**

This process can take **weeks**, sometimes even longer.\
**All for a single line of code.**

I'm sure you can see the issue here.

#### A Visual Example

Let's return to our monolithic application diagram.

Let's say one small component - perhaps one in the top left - needs a change. The change itself is minimal. It could literally be **a one-line update**.

But due to the tightly coupled nature of monolithic architecture, this one small change **requires the entire application to be tested**.

And here's where things get worse:\
During testing, you may discover **bugs in completely unrelated parts of the system**. These components shouldn't be affected, but because everything in a monolith is so **tightly coupled**, changes in one area can have unexpected ripple effects in others.

Now you're stuck in a loop:

1.  Fix the newly discovered bugs
2.  Retest the system
3.  Find more bugs
4.  Fix again
5.  Retest again

Only **after several rounds of fixes and testing** can you finally deploy your application.

And again, this whole process started because of **one small change in a single component**.

* * * * *

### Summary: Why Monolithic Deployment Is a Bottleneck

As you can see, **monolithic deployment is extremely inflexible**. It forces teams into **lengthy, repetitive cycles** and turns even minor updates into major efforts.

This inflexibility is one of the key reasons why organizations began searching for **more agile, modular architectural approaches** - which eventually led to the rise of **microservices**.


### Another Problem: Inefficient Use of Compute Resources

Another significant drawback of monolithic architecture is the **inefficient use of compute resources**, especially **CPU and RAM**.

In a monolithic application, all components run within a **single process**. This process consumes compute resources collectively and **distributes them across all internal components**, regardless of individual needs.

This setup isn't always ideal.

#### Why Is This a Problem?

Let's say one specific component requires more compute power - maybe it's performing intensive calculations or handling a heavy load. In a monolithic architecture, there's **no way to allocate more resources** just to that component.

Instead, we're forced to **scale the entire monolithic process**, increasing resources for **all components** - even those that don't need them.

This results in **wasted CPU and memory**, because:

-   Components that don't need more power still get it
-   Components that **do** need more power only get **a portion** of the increased resources

And that's extremely **inefficient**.

* * * * *

#### A Closer Look at the Scenario

Let's revisit our monolithic app example.

Suppose the application is running on a machine with:

-   **4 vCores** (virtual CPU cores)
-   **8 GB of RAM**

Now, imagine one of the components starts performing **intensive computations** and requires more CPU and memory.

In a monolithic setup, your only option is to **increase resources for the entire application**. So, you scale up to:

-   **8 vCores**
-   **16 GB of RAM**

But here's the issue:

-   All the components now get more resources - even though most of them **don't need** the upgrade
-   The component that **does** need more resources **still only gets a share**, because everything runs in the same process

This leads to a situation where you're paying for extra infrastructure, but **not optimizing its use**.

* * * * *

### Summary: Wasting Resources in a Monolith

To sum it up:

-   In a monolithic architecture, **compute resources are shared across all components**
-   There is **no way to fine-tune resource allocation** for individual parts of the application
-   Scaling becomes **expensive and inefficient**, as you're forced to scale the **entire app** rather than the part that needs it

This inefficiency is another reason organizations began looking for **more modular, scalable architectures** - like **microservices**, which allow individual components to be deployed, scaled, and optimized independently.

### The Next Problem: Large and Complex Codebase

Another major issue in monolithic architecture is what we call the **"large and complex" problem**.

This challenge shares some similarities with the **inefficient resource utilization** issue we discussed earlier, but it also introduces **distinct concerns** related to software complexity, maintainability, and long-term viability.

* * * * *

### Why Is This a Problem?

In a monolithic application, **all software components exist within a single codebase** and run as part of a single process. Over time, this naturally leads to a **very large and complex codebase**, full of dependencies and tight coupling between components.

Here's what that means in practice:

-   Every **small change** can potentially impact **other unrelated components**
-   There is **no clear isolation** between parts of the system
-   Ensuring that changes don't create side effects is **extremely difficult**

Because of this, **every change** - even a tiny one - requires **extensive testing** to ensure the system still functions correctly. But even with rigorous testing, **bugs can still slip through** and make it to production.

This fragility makes the system **difficult and risky to maintain**.

* * * * *

### The Developer Impact

When every minor change involves a lengthy and stressful verification process, even **simple updates become a nightmare**.

And there's a psychological side effect too:\
If every small update risks breaking the system, **developers become hesitant to make changes** at all.

The result?

-   Features are delayed
-   Bugs go unfixed
-   The system becomes **stagnant and outdated**

And that's a situation no development team wants to be in.

* * * * *

### A Visual Example

Let's revisit our monolithic application once more.

Suppose you modify **a single component** - say, the top-left one in the diagram.

Although it's a local change, the **tight coupling** between components means the change could ripple through the rest of the application. So, you need to:

1.  **Test the entire system**
2.  **Detect bugs caused by the change**
3.  **Fix those bugs**
4.  **Retest the entire system again**
5.  Only then can you **deploy to production**

And this long, **fragile process** must be repeated for **every minor change**.

* * * * *

### Summary: Complexity Slows Everything Down

To summarize:

-   Monoliths naturally evolve into **large, tightly coupled codebases**
-   **Lack of isolation** between components makes changes risky
-   **Heavy testing** is required for every update
-   Developers become **reluctant to make changes**, causing the system to become obsolete
-   Maintenance becomes slow, expensive, and error-prone

This is yet another reason why teams and organizations have moved toward **microservices**, where modular design and independent components help tackle exactly these kinds of challenges.


### Shifting Focus: From Monolith to SOA

So far, we've discussed several key problems associated with **monolithic architecture**. Now, let's turn our attention to **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** and explore why it, too, presented significant challenges - despite its initial promise.

### Problem #1: The Complicated and Expensive ESB

One of the core components of SOA is the **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**. As you might recall, the ESB is responsible for **handling all communication** between the various services or applications in the system.

The ESB takes care of:

-   **Routing** requests
-   **Validating** data
-   **Authenticating** users
-   **Aggregating** service responses
-   And much more

Without the ESB, each individual service would have to handle these concerns on its own - which would result in duplicated logic and inconsistencies.

Sounds useful, right?

Well, **not quite**.

### The Problem with the ESB

While the ESB aimed to centralize and simplify communication, it often became a **bloated, expensive, and overly complex bottleneck** in the system.

Here's why:

-   ESB platforms were typically built by large enterprise vendors like **Oracle** and **IBM**
-   From the very beginning, these tools were **expensive to license and operate**
-   They required **dedicated teams with specialized expertise** just to keep them running smoothly

As a result, **only large organizations with deep pockets** could afford to implement and maintain a full-fledged ESB.

Startups and smaller companies?\
They **avoided SOA altogether**, largely because of the ESB.

This lack of accessibility directly impacted the **popularity and long-term viability** of the SOA model.

### Trying to Do Too Much

The deeper issue was that the ESB **tried to do everything** - from routing to security to orchestration. And, as we know in software architecture:

> "When a single component tries to do everything, it rarely ends well."

Because of this overreach, ESBs quickly became **monolithic systems themselves** - ironically introducing many of the same problems SOA was designed to avoid.

-   They were **difficult to upgrade**
-   **Hard to debug**
-   **Slow to evolve**
-   And often became **single points of failure**

### A Practical Example

Let's say you have a typical SOA system with several connected services. The ESB sits at the center, managing the entire interaction landscape.

While this centralized approach *seems* clean in theory, in reality, **everything depends on the ESB working perfectly**. When it doesn't, the whole system is affected.

Over time, many organizations found themselves spending more effort **maintaining the ESB** than developing new services or delivering value to users.

Instead of enabling agility, the ESB often became a **roadblock**.

### Summary: The Downfall of the ESB - and SOA

To summarize:

-   The ESB was **central to SOA**, but also **its biggest weakness**
-   It was **expensive, complex, and hard to maintain**
-   It created **barriers for smaller companies** and **slowed down larger ones**
-   Organizations ended up **abandoning SOA**, not because the idea was flawed - but because the **implementation model was too heavy**

This problem alone played a major role in the **decline of SOA** and set the stage for the rise of **microservices**, which sought to eliminate the need for a heavyweight central orchestrator.


### The Final Problem: Lack of Tooling

Tooling forms the foundation of any successful architecture, and for **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** to truly shine, **short development cycles** were essential.

After all, one of the major problems with the monolith was its **long development and deployment cycles**. SOA promised to improve on that by enabling faster testing, deployment, and iteration.

This promise was the **holy grail** of service-based architecture and a major motivation for adopting SOA.

### The Reality Check

However, there was a big catch.

For SOA to deliver on this promise, it needed **robust tooling** - tools that could support rapid testing, deployment, and monitoring of multiple services.

The problem? **Such tools simply didn't exist at the time.**

Most testing and deployment processes were **manual, slow, and error-prone**.

And here's the kicker: testing a service-oriented system is inherently **more complex** than testing a monolith (we'll dive deeper into why later in this course).

As a result, manually testing SOA systems **often took longer than testing monoliths**, frustrating developers and delaying releases.

### The Bottom Line

Ultimately, the goal of **reducing development time was not met**.

Creating and maintaining a service-oriented system took **much longer than building a monolith**.

This was a harsh reality that no organization wanted to accept.

And it's one of the key reasons why many service-oriented systems were **doomed to fail** or abandoned in favor of other approaches.

### Wrapping Up: Understanding the Challenges

So, that's a brief overview of the major problems with both **monolithic** and **service-oriented architectures**.

Understanding these challenges is crucial as we move forward to explore **microservices** - an architectural pattern designed to overcome many of these limitations.

### Additional Problems with Monolithic Architecture

1.  **Scalability Limitations**\
    Since the entire app is one process, you can only scale it **vertically** (e.g., bigger server), which has physical limits and is costly. You can't easily scale just the parts of the app that need more resources.

2.  **Slower Innovation and Deployment**\
    Because everything is tightly coupled, making changes requires full regression testing and redeployment, which slows down innovation and makes continuous delivery difficult.

3.  **Harder to Adopt New Technologies**\
    The entire monolith is often stuck on a single tech stack, making it harder to adopt new languages, frameworks, or databases for specific features.

4.  **Team Coordination Bottlenecks**\
    Large monolithic apps often mean large teams working on the same codebase, increasing merge conflicts, coordination overhead, and slowing down development.

* * * * *

### Additional Problems with Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

1.  **Service Overhead and Latency**\
    Communication between services usually happens over a network, adding latency and complexity compared to in-process calls within a monolith.

2.  **Complex Governance**\
    Managing many services requires strong governance policies for versioning, security, and deployment - without which things can get chaotic.

3.  **Data Management Challenges**\
    SOA services often have to share data, but maintaining data consistency across distributed services can be difficult without strong coordination, often requiring complex transactional patterns.

4.  **Lack of Standardization**\
    Since SOA often involves heterogeneous systems, inconsistent protocols, and technologies can cause integration headaches.

5.  **Security Complexity**\
    More services and endpoints mean a larger attack surface, requiring more sophisticated security measures across the board.
