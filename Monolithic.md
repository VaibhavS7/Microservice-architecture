### What is Monolithic Architecture?

Monolithic architecture is the original architecture---the father of all others, the ancestor of the various architectures we have today. In fact, monolithic architecture is not just an ancestor. There are still many monolithic applications in use today, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Some scenarios are better suited for monolithic architecture, and there's no reason not to use it in these cases.

With monolithic architecture, all software components are executed in a single process. This means there is no distribution involved. All components share the same threads, memory, and compute power. Essentially, it's a huge chunk of code running happily on its own, minding its own business.

### The Tight Coupling in Monolithic Architecture

Now, naturally, when the entire application runs in a single process, there is a very strong coupling between all the classes. The pieces of code are tightly interconnected, with nothing separating them. No network, no standard API - nothing.

Another common attribute of monolithic architecture is that it is often implemented as a silo. What this means is that the monolithic application is a standalone app that neither shares data nor functionality with other apps. These applications do not expose anything that could help other apps, whether in terms of data or functionality. There is no external API, no listeners of any kind---nothing that acknowledges that the app exists within an ecosystem and would be willing to help other apps in that ecosystem.

No, the monolithic app lives in its own world, keeping its data and functionality close to its chest. Nothing can get out.

### A Typical Example: The HR App

Let's take a look at a typical monolithic application. Consider an HR app. As we said, a monolithic HR app is essentially a single process. This process hosts all the components of the application. Notice how all the components in the diagram are enclosed within this process, making the application a true monolith without any distribution.

However, in reality, monolithic applications are not always comprised of a single process. They often have a database, which is usually hosted in another process (unless using an in-memory database like SQLite). And this is especially true for web apps, where the user interface often resides in a different process. In web apps, the user interface is typically a web browser, which is a separate process running on a separate machine.

But even if the database or user interface are in separate processes, the application is still considered monolithic because the core of the application---where the actual work is done---is still a monolith.

### The Challenge of Integration in Monolithic Systems

Now, what happens when you introduce another app alongside the HR app? For instance, let's say the organization also has a purchasing app, which is also a monolith. These two apps run independently of each other, not interfering with one another, and each minds its own business. But then a new requirement comes in, and suddenly they need to communicate with one another.

For example, the HR system might need to know which orders were made by an employee, or the purchasing system might need to know who is the supervisor of the employee placing an order. Whatever the case may be, these two applications need to be able to share data with each other.

Unfortunately, this is not easy to do in a monolithic application. As we mentioned earlier, monolithic applications are often silos and don't expose ways to share data and functionality. Making these two apps communicate with each other becomes a cumbersome, frustrating process. It can be done, but it's not easy.

### Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

Now that we've discussed some of the problems with monolithic architecture, we'll talk more about them later. But there are also advantages to monolithic architecture. Let's look at two of them.

1.  **Easier Design:** First, it's much easier to design a monolithic application. Think about it: with a monolith, there's no network, no messaging mechanisms, no queues, and no need for cross-process debugging. It's much simpler. And simpler isn't always worse.

2.  **Performance:** Additionally, when developed correctly, monolithic applications can be quite performant. There are no network operations, no serialization or deserialization layers---everything runs in the same process. Monolithic apps can be incredibly fast, often much faster than distributed systems.

### Conclusion: Is Monolithic Architecture Still Relevant?

So that's an overview of monolithic architecture. While it has some clear drawbacks, particularly when it comes to integration with other systems, it still offers simplicity and performance. For certain applications or smaller projects, it can be an excellent choice. However, as your system grows, so too does the complexity of managing a monolithic architecture.

Stay tuned as we explore more on this topic and discuss how modern architectures like microservices address some of the challenges of the monolith.
